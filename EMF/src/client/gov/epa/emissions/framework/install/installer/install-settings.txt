Building the EMF Client Installer

- Run the ant task "client-installer(only jar)" to create the file emf-client-installer.jar in EMF/build/sandbox/. The batch file runinstaller.bat is also copied to EMF/build/sandbox/.
  - emf-client-installer.jar contains:
    gov/epa/emissions/framework/install/installer/*
    gov/epa/emissions/framework/client/preference/CommentedProperties.class
    EMFPrefsTemplate.txt
